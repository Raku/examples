  (*) Reverse a list.</STRONG><P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p06.lisp">P06</A> 
  (*) Find out whether a list is a palindrome.</STRONG>    
    <DD>A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p07.lisp">P07</A> 
  (**) Flatten a nested list structure.</STRONG>    
    <DD>Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a `flat'
    list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).<BR><BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (my-flatten '(a (b (c d) e)))<BR>
    (A B C D E)<BR><BR>
    Hint: Use the predefined functions list and append.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p08.lisp">P08</A> 
  (**) Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.</STRONG>    
    <DD>If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced
    with a single copy of the element. The order of the elements should
    not be changed.<BR><BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (compress '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))<BR>
    (A B C A D E)<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p09.lisp">P09</A> 
  (**) Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists.</STRONG>
    <DD>If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed
    in separate sublists.<BR><BR>
    Example:<BR>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p10.lisp">P10</A> 
  (*) Run-length encoding of a list.</STRONG>
    <DD>Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called
    run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates
    of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number
    of duplicates of the element E.<BR><BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (encode '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))<BR>
    ((4 A) (1 B) (2 C) (2 A) (1 D)(4 E))<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p11.lisp">P11</A> 
  (*) Modified run-length encoding.</STRONG>
    <DD>Modify the result of problem P10 in such a way that if an element
    has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only
    elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.<BR><BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (encode-modified '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))<BR>
    ((4 A) B (2 C) (2 A) D (4 E))<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p12.lisp">P12</A> 
  (**) Decode a run-length encoded list.</STRONG>
    <DD>Given a run-length code list generated as specified
    in problem P11. Construct its uncompressed version.<P> 

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p13.lisp">P13</A> 
  (**) Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution).</STRONG>
    <DD>Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression 
    method directly. I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists 
    containing the duplicates, as in problem P09, but only count them.
    As in problem P11, simplify the result list by replacing the singleton 
    lists (1 X) by X.<BR><BR> 
    Example:<BR>
    * (encode-direct '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))<BR>
    ((4 A) B (2 C) (2 A) D (4 E))<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p14.lisp">P14</A> 
  (*) Duplicate the elements of a list.</STRONG>
    <DD>Example:<BR>
    * (dupli '(a b c c d))<BR>
    (A A B B C C C C D D)<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p15.lisp">P15</A> 
  (**) Replicate the elements of a list a given number of times.</STRONG>

    (A A A B B B C C C)<BR><BR>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p16.lisp">P16</A> 
  (**) Drop every N'th element from a list.</STRONG>
    <DD>Example:<BR>
    * (drop '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3)<BR>
    (A B D E G H K)<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p17.lisp">P17</A> 
  (*) Split a list into two parts; the length of the first
    part is given.</STRONG>
    <DD>Do not use any predefined predicates.<BR><BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (split '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3)<BR>
    ( (A B C) (D E F G H I K))<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p18.lisp">P18</A> 
  (**) Extract a slice from a list.</STRONG>
    <DD>Given two indices, I and K, the slice is the list
    containing the elements between the I'th and K'th element
    of the original list (both limits included). Start counting
    the elements with 1.<BR><BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (slice '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3 7)<BR>
    (C D E F G)<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p19.lisp">P19</A> 
  (**) Rotate a list N places to the left.</STRONG>
    <DD>Examples:<BR>
    * (rotate '(a b c d e f g h) 3)<BR>
    (D E F G H A B C)<BR><BR>
    * (rotate '(a b c d e f g h) -2)<BR>
    (G H A B C D E F)<BR><BR>
    Hint: Use the predefined functions length and append,
    as well as the result of problem P17.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p20.lisp">P20</A> 
  (*) Remove the K'th element from a list.</STRONG>
    <DD>Example:<BR>
    * (remove-at '(a b c d) 2)<BR>
    (A C D)<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p21.lisp">P21</A> 
  (*) Insert an element at a given position into a list.</STRONG>

    (A ALFA B C D)<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p22.lisp">P22</A> 
  (*) Create a list containing all integers within a given range.</STRONG>
    <DD>If first argument is smaller than second, produce a list in
  decreasing order.<BR>
    <DD>Example:<BR>
    * (range 4 9)<BR>
    (4 5 6 7 8 9)<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p23.lisp">P23</A> 
  (**) Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from a 
  list.</STRONG>
    <DD>The selected items shall be returned in a list.<BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (rnd-select '(a b c d e f g h) 3)<BR>
    (E D A)<BR><BR>
    Hint: Use the built-in random number generator and the
    result of problem P20.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p24.lisp">P24</A> 
  (*) Lotto: Draw N different random numbers from the set 1..M.</STRONG>
    <DD>The selected numbers shall be returned in a list.<BR>
    Example:<BR>
    * (lotto-select 6 49)<BR>
    (23 1 17 33 21 37)<BR><BR>
    Hint: Combine the solutions of problems P22 and P23.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p25.lisp">P25</A> 
  (*) Generate a random permutation of the elements of a list.</STRONG>
    <DD>Example:<BR>
    * (rnd-permu '(a b c d e f))<BR>
    (B A D C E F)<BR><BR>
    Hint: Use the solution of problem P23.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p26.lisp">P26</A> 
  (**) Generate the combinations of K distinct objects
      chosen from the N elements of a list</STRONG>
    <DD>
    In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 
    12 people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities 
    (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). For pure
    mathematicians, this result may be great. But <i>we</i> want to
    really generate all the possibilities in a list.<br><br> 
    Example:<BR>
    * (combination 3 '(a b c d e f))<BR>
    ((A B C) (A B D) (A B E) ... )
    <p>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p27.lisp">P27</A> 
  (**) Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets.</STRONG>
    <DD>
    a) In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint subgroups 
    of 2, 3 and 4 persons? Write a function that generates all the
    possibilities and returns them in a list.<br><br>
    Example:<br>
    * (group3 '(aldo beat carla david evi flip gary hugo ida))<br>
    ( ( (ALDO BEAT) (CARLA DAVID EVI) (FLIP GARY HUGO IDA) )<br>
    ... )<br><br>
    b) Generalize the above predicate in a way that we can specify a list
    of group sizes and the predicate will return a list of groups.<br><br>
    Example:<br>
    * (group '(aldo beat carla david evi flip gary hugo ida) '(2 2 5))<br>
    ( ( (ALDO BEAT) (CARLA DAVID) (EVI FLIP GARY HUGO IDA) )<br>
    ... )<br><br>
    Note that we do not want permutations of the group members; i.e.
    ((ALDO BEAT) ...) is the same solution as ((BEAT ALDO) ...). However,
    we make a difference between ((ALDO BEAT) (CARLA DAVID) ...) and
    ((CARLA DAVID) (ALDO BEAT) ...).<br><br>
    You may find more about this combinatorial problem in a good book 
    on discrete mathematics under the term "multinomial coefficients".
   <p>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p28.lisp">P28</A> 
  (**) Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists</STRONG>
    <DD>
    a) We suppose that a list contains elements that are 
    lists themselves. The objective is to sort the elements of this list
    according to their <b>length</b>. E.g. short lists first, longer lists
    later, or vice versa.<br><br>
    Example:<br>
    * (lsort '((a b c) (d e) (f g h) (d e) (i j k l) (m n) (o)))<br>
    ((O) (D E) (D E) (M N) (A B C) (F G H) (I J K L))<br>
    <br>
    b) Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are 
    lists themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements
    of this list according to their <b>length frequency</b>; i.e.,
     in the default,
    where sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed
    first, others with a more frequent length come later.<br><br>
    Example:<br>
    * (lfsort '((a b c) (d e) (f g h) (d e) (i j k l) (m n) (o)))<br>
    ((i j k l) (o) (a b c) (f g h) (d e) (d e) (m n))<br>
    <br>
    Note that in the above example, the first two lists in the result 
    have length 4 and 1, both lengths appear just once. The third and 
    forth list have length 3 which appears twice (there are two list of this 
    length). And finally, the last three lists have length 2. This is 
    the most frequent length.

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p32.lisp">P32</A> 
  (**) Determine the greatest common divisor of two positive integer

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p33.lisp">P33</A> 
  (*) Determine whether two positive integer numbers are coprime.</STRONG>
    <DD>Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1.<BR>

    T<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p34.lisp">P34</A> 
  (**) Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m).</STRONG> 
    <DD>Euler's so-called totient function phi(m) is defined as the number
    of positive integers r (1 &lt;= r &lt; m) that are coprime to m.<P>
    Example: m = 10: r = 1,3,7,9; thus phi(m) = 4.
    Note the special case: phi(1) = 1.<P>
    * (totient-phi 10)<BR>
    4<P>
    Find out what the value of phi(m) is if m is a prime number.
    Euler's totient function plays an important role in one of the
    most widely used public key cryptography methods (RSA). In this
    exercise you should use the most primitive method to calculate 
    this function (there are smarter ways that we shall discuss later).<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p35.lisp">P35</A> 
  (**) Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer.</STRONG>
    <DD>Construct a flat list containing the prime factors 
        in ascending order.<BR>

    <A href="p13.lisp">P13</a>.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p37.lisp">P37</A> 
  (**) Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m) (improved).</STRONG> 
    <DD>See problem P34 for the definition of Euler's totient function.
    If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the form
    of problem P36 then the function phi(m) can be efficiently 
    calculated as follows:
    Let ((p1 m1) (p2 m2) (p3 m3) ...) be the list of prime factors (and 
    their multiplicities) of a given number m. Then phi(m) can be calculated
    with the following formula:<P>
    phi(m) = (p1 - 1) * p1 ** (m1 - 1) + (p2 - 1) * p2 ** (m2 - 1) + 
    (p3 - 1) * p3 ** (m3 - 1) + ...<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p38.lisp">P38</A> 
  (*) Compare the two methods of calculating Euler's totient function.</STRONG>
    <DD>Use the solutions of problems P34 and P37 to compare the algorithms.
    Take the number of logical inferences as a measure for efficiency.
    Try to calculate phi(10090) as an example.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p39.lisp">P39</A> 
  (*) A list of prime numbers.</STRONG>
    <DD> Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, construct
    a list of all prime numbers in that range.<P>

  <DT><STRONG><A href="p40.lisp">P40</A> 
  (**) Goldbach's conjecture.</STRONG>
    <DD>Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number 
    greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Example: 28 = 5 + 23. 
    It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not 
    been proved to be correct in the general case. 
    It has been <em>numerically</em>
    confirmed up to very large numbers (much larger than we can go with our 
    Prolog system). Write a predicate to find the two prime numbers
    that sum up to a given even integer.<P>
    Example:<BR>
    * (goldbach 28)<BR>
    (5 23)<P>
 
 <DT><STRONG><A href="p41.lisp">P41</A> 
  (**) A list of Goldbach compositions.</STRONG>
    <DD> Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, print
    a list of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition.<P>
    Example:<BR>
    * (goldbach-list 9 20)<BR>
    10 = 3 + 7<BR>
    12 = 5 + 7<BR>
    14 = 3 + 11<BR>
    16 = 3 + 13<BR>
    18 = 5 + 13<BR>
    20 = 3 + 17<P>

    In most cases, if an even number is written as the sum of two
    prime numbers, one of them is very small. Very rarely, the primes
    are both bigger than say 50. Try to find out how many such cases
    there are in the range 2..3000.<P>
    Example (for a print limit of 50):<BR>
    * (goldbach-list 1 2000 50)<BR>
    992 = 73 + 919<BR>
    1382 = 61 + 1321<BR>
    1856 = 67 + 1789<BR>
    1928 = 61 + 1867<P>

<H2>Logic and Codes</H2>
<DL>
   <DT><B><A HREF="p46.lisp">P46</A> 
   (**) Truth tables for logical expressions.</B>
   <DD>Define predicates and/2, or/2, nand/2, nor/2, xor/2, impl/2 
    and equ/2 (for logical equivalence) which succeed or
    fail according to the result of their respective operations; e.g.
    and(A,B) will succeed, if and only if both A and B succeed.
    Note that A and B can be Prolog goals (not only the constants
    true and fail).<P>
    A logical expression in two variables can then be written in 
    prefix notation, as in the following example: and(or(A,B),nand(A,B)).<P>
    Now, write a predicate table/3 which prints the truth table of a
    given logical expression in two variables.<P>

    Example:<BR>
    * table(A,B,and(A,or(A,B))).<BR>
    <TT>
    true  true  true<BR>
    true  fail  true<BR>
    fail  true  fail<BR>

   <DT><B><A HREF="p47.lisp">P47</A> 
   (*) Truth tables for logical expressions (2).</B>
   <DD>Continue problem P46 by defining and/2, or/2, etc as being
   operators. This allows to write the logical expression in the
   more natural way, as in the example: A and (A or not B).
   Define operator precedence as usual; i.e. as in Java.<P>

   Example:<BR>
   * table(A,B, A and (A or not B)).<BR>

   expression may contain any number of logical variables.
   Define table/2 in a way that table(List,Expr) prints the
   truth table for the expression Expr, which contains the
   logical variables enumerated in List.<P>

   (**) Gray code.</B>
   <DD> An n-bit Gray code is a sequence of n-bit strings constructed

   n = 1: C(1) = ['0','1'].<br>
   n = 2: C(2) = ['00','01','11','10'].<br>
   n = 3: C(3) = ['000','001','011','010',´110´,´111´,´101´,´100´].<br><br>
   Find out the construction rules and write a predicate with the following
   specification:<br><br>
   % gray(N,C) :- C is the N-bit Gray code<br><br>
   Can you apply the method of "result caching" in order to make the predicate
   more efficient, when it is to be used repeatedly?

   <DT><B><A HREF="p50.lisp">P50</A> 
   (***) Huffman code.</B>
   <DD> First of all, consult a good book on discrete mathematics or 
   algorithms for a detailed description of Huffman codes!<br><br>
   We suppose a set of symbols with their frequencies, given as a list of
   fr(S,F) terms. Example: 
   [fr(a,45),fr(b,13),fr(c,12),fr(d,16),fr(e,9),fr(f,5)]. Our objective is to
   construct a list hc(S,C) terms, where C is the Huffman code word for 
   the symbol S. In our example, the result could be Hs = [hc(a,'0'), 
   hc(b,'101'), hc(c,'100'), hc(d,'111'), hc(e,'1101'), 
   hc(f,'1100')] [hc(a,'01'),...etc.]. 
   The task shall be performed by the predicate huffman/2 defined as follows:

   % huffman(Fs,Hs) :- Hs is the Huffman code table for the frequency table Fs

<H2>Binary Trees</H2>
<p>
<strong>
<font color="red">A binary tree is either empty or it is composed of a root
element and two successors, which are binary trees themselves.</font></strong> 
<img src="p67.gif" align="left" hspace="20">
<br>In Lisp we represent the empty tree by 'nil' and the 
non-empty tree by the list (X L R), where X denotes the root 
node and L and R denote the left and right subtree, respectively.
The example tree depicted opposite is therefore represented by the 
following list: <br><br>
(a (b (d nil nil) (e nil nil)) (c nil (f (g nil nil) nil)))
<br><br>
Other examples are a binary tree that consists of a root node only:<br><br>
(a nil nil) or an empty binary tree: nil.
</p>

	that in a levelorder tree traversal all internal nodes come
	first, the leaves come second, and empty successors (the nil's

   <DD> Given a binary tree as the usual Prolog term t(X,L,R) (or nil).
        As a preparation for drawing the tree, a layout algorithm is

   Lisp is a prominent functional programming language, which is used

   the main competitors of Prolog. In Lisp almost everything is a list, 
   just as in Prolog everything is a term.

   The following pictures show how multiway tree structures are 
   represented in Lisp.
   <br /> 
   <img src="p73.png" vspace="15">
   <br />   
   Note that in the "lispy" notation a node with successors (children)
   in the tree is always the first element in a list, followed by its
   children. 
   The "lispy" representation of a multiway tree is a sequence of
   atoms and parentheses '(' and ')', which we shall collectively 
   call "tokens". We can represent this sequence of tokens
   as a Prolog list; e.g. the lispy expression (a (b c)) could be 
   represented as the Prolog list ['(', a, '(', b, c, ')', ')'].
   Write a predicate tree-ltl(T,LTL) which constructs the "lispy
   token list" LTL if the tree is given as term T in the usual
   Prolog notation.<br /><br />

<H2>Graphs</H2>
<strong>
<font color="red">A graph is defined as a set of <i>nodes</i> 
and a set of <i>edges</i>, where each edge is a pair of nodes.</font></strong>
<p>
There are several ways to represent graphs in Prolog. One method is to
represent each edge separately as one clause (fact). In this form,
the graph depicted below is represented as the following predicate:
<img src="graph1.gif" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="10">
<pre>
edge(h,g).
edge(k,f).
edge(f,b).
...
</pre>
We call this <i>edge-clause form</i>. Obviously,
isolated nodes cannot be represented.
Another method is to represent the whole graph as one data object. According
to the definition of the graph as a pair of two sets (nodes and edges), we
may use the following Prolog term to represent the example graph:
<pre>
graph([b,c,d,f,g,h,k],[e(b,c),e(b,f),e(c,f),e(f,k),e(g,h)])
</pre>
We call this <i>graph-term form</i>. Note, that the lists are kept sorted,
they are really <i>sets</i>, without duplicated elements. Each edge 
appears only once in the edge list; i.e. an edge from
a node x to another node y is represented as e(x,y), the term e(y,x)
is not present. <b>The graph-term form is our default representation.</b>
In SWI-Prolog there are predefined predicates to work 
with sets.
<p>
A third representation method is to associate with each node the set
of nodes that are adjacent to that node. We call this the
<i>adjacency-list form</i>. In our example:
<pre>
[n(b,[c,f]), n(c,[b,f]), n(d,[]), n(f,[b,c,k]), ...]
</pre>
The representations we introduced so far are Prolog terms and therefore
well suited for automated processing, but their syntax  is not very 
user-friendly. Typing the terms by hand is cumbersome and error-prone.
We can define a more compact and "human-friendly" notation 
as follows: A graph is represented by a list of atoms and terms of 
the type X-Y (i.e. functor '-' and arity 2). The atoms stand for 
isolated nodes, the X-Y terms describe edges. If an X appears as an 
endpoint of an edge, it is automatically defined as a node. 
Our example could be written as:<br>
<pre>
[b-c, f-c, g-h, d, f-b, k-f, h-g]
</pre>
We call this the <i>human-friendly form</i>. As the example shows, 
the list does not have to be sorted and may even contain the same 
edge multiple times. Notice the isolated node d. (Actually, isolated
nodes do not even have to be atoms in the Prolog sense, they can
be compound terms, as in <tt>d(3.75,blue)</tt> instead of d in the example).
<p>
<br clear="left">
<img src="graph2.gif" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="10">
When the edges are <i>directed</i> we call them <i>arcs</i>. These
are represented by <i>ordered</i> pairs. Such a graph is called 
<b>directed graph</b>. To represent a directed graph, the forms 
discussed above are slightly modified. The example graph opposite
is represented as follows:
<p>

Finally, graphs and digraphs may have additional information attached
to nodes and edges (arcs). For the nodes, this is no problem, as we can
easily replace the single character identifiers with arbitrary compound
terms, such as <tt>city('London',4711)</tt>. On the other hand, for
edges we have to extend our notation. Graphs with additional information
attached to edges are called <b>labelled graphs</b>.<p>

   and, accordingly, the edges from 1 to N-1 in such a way, that for 
   each edge K the difference of its node numbers equals to K.

   Every spot in the puzzle belongs to a (horizontal) row and a (vertical)
   column, as well as to one single 3x3 square (which we call "square" 
   for short). At the beginning, some of the spots carry a single-digit
   number between 1 and 9. The problem is to fill the missing spots with
   digits in such a way that every number between 1 and 9 appears exactly
   once in each row, in each column, and in each square.

   and reveal a picture or diagram." As a Prolog programmer, you are in 
   a better situation: you can have your computer do the work! Just write
   a little program ;-).<p>
   The puzzle goes like this: Essentially, each row and column of a 
   rectangular bitmap is annotated with the respective lengths of 
   its distinct strings of occupied cells. The person who solves the puzzle 
   must complete the bitmap given only these lengths.

   Given an empty (or almost empty) framework of a crossword puzzle and 
   a set of words. The problem is to place the words into the framework.<p>
   <img src="p99.gif" align="left" hspace="20">
   The particular crossword puzzle is specified in a text file which
   first lists the words (one word per line) in an arbitrary order. Then,
   after an empty line, the crossword framework is defined. In this 
   framework specification, an empty character location is represented
   by a dot (.). In order to make the solution easier, character locations 
   can also contain predefined character values. The puzzle opposite
   is defined in the file <a href="p99a.dat">p99a.dat</a>, other examples
   are <a href="p99b.dat">p99b.dat</a> and <a href="p99d.dat">p99d.dat</a>.
   There is also an example of a puzzle (<a href="p99c.dat">p99c.dat</a>)
   which does not have a solution.   
   <br><br>
   <i>Words</i> are strings (character lists) of at least two characters. 
   A horizontal or vertical sequence of character places in the 
   crossword puzzle framework is called a <i>site</i>. 
   Our problem is to find a compatible way of placing words onto sites.
   <br clear="left">
   <p>
   <b>Hints:</b> (1) The problem is not easy. You will need some time to 
   thoroughly understand it. So, don't give up too early! And remember
   that the objective is a clean solution, not just a quick-and-dirty hack!<br>
   (2) Reading the data file is a tricky problem for which a solution 
   is provided in the file
   <a href="p99-readfile.lisp">p99-readfile.lisp</a>. Use the predicate
   read_lines/2.<br>
   (3) For efficiency reasons it is important, at least for
   larger puzzles, to sort the words and the sites in a particular order.
   For this part of the problem, the solution of
   <a href="p28.lisp">P28</a> may be very helpful.
