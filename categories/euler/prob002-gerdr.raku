Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. By starting with three terms 1, 1, and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
