NOTE: 
	- This is a port of the pugs/examples/cookbook to support Rakudo
	- They are being added as they are made to work

This is PLEAC, from http://pleac.sourceforge.net/.

PLEAC stands for "Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook."  Think "Perl6
Cookbook."  This is our attempt to recreate the Perl5 Cookbook but with proper
Perl6 idioms.  Naturally, it's an evolving process.

Note the naming of the directories and the files are done in such a way as to
mirror the Cookbook (2nd Edition) and to ease sorting.  Please do not use the
1st edition sections names.
